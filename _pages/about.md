I am a first year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) at the University of California, San Diego, advised by Prof. [Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Bio-industrial Mechatronics Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, and master degree in ECE at the University of California, San Diego.
